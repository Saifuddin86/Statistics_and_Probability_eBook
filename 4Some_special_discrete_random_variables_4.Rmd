# Some special discrete random variables

## Bernoulli r.v

-   **PMF**: $P(X=x)=f(x)=p^x(1-p)^{1-x}; \ \ x=0,1$
-   **Mean**: $\mu=E(X)=p$
-   **Variance**: $\sigma^2 =E(X-\mu)^2=E(X^2)-\mu^2=p(1-p)$

## Binomial r.v

-   Consider an experiment of tossing a biased coin 3(number of trials, n) times.
-   Tosses are *independent*, each toss has only **TWO** Outcomes-*Head (Success)* and *Tail (Failure)*

**This type of trial is called the *Bernoulli Trial***

-   Suppose, $P(H)=p$ and remain constant in each toss, consequently, $P(T)=1-p=q$ (let).

**Suppose**, $X=\# \ \ of\ \ head\ \ (successes)\ \  in\ \ 3\ \ tosses$

Now, what is the probability that, we will have **exactly 2 heads (success) in 3 tosses?**

**That is,** $P(X=2)=?$

Now, this can happen in the following ways:

$$P(X=2)=P(HHT)+P(HTH)+P(THH)$$ $$=P(H)P(H)P(T)+P(H)P(T)P(H)+P(T)P(H)P(H)$$ [*Since tosses are independent*]

$$=p.p.q+p.q.p+q.p.p$$ $$=p^2 q+p^2 q+p^2 q=3p^2 q$$ $$\therefore P(X=2)=\binom{3}{2}p^2q^{3-2}$$ If, $p=0.6$ is given, then we can easily compute $P(X=2)=f(2)$. Now, if we repeat the toss 10 times $(n=10)$, with $P(H)=p$, what is the value of $P(X=3)=f(3)$?

**So**, for $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with a constant probability of success, $p$, the probability mass function (PMF) of the random variable, $X$=# of successes in $n$ trials is given below:

-   **PMF**:$P(X=x)=f(x)=\binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^x ;x=0,1,2,...,n$

-   **CDF**: $P(X\le x)=F(x)=f(0)+f(1)+...+f(x)$

-   **Mean**:$\mu=E(X)=np$

-   **Variance**:$\sigma^2 =np(1-p)$

-   **We write** $X\sim Binom(n,p)$

-   $n$ and $p$ are said to be the *parameters* of the Binomial distribution.

**N.B:** $f(x)=F(x)-F(x-1)$ i.e $f(3)=F(3)-F(2)$

**Finding Binomial probability manually**

Suppose, $X\sim Binom(n,p)$; where $n=5$ and $p=0.6$. Find, *(i)* $P(X=2)$ *(ii)* $P(X \le 2)$ *(iii)* $P(X\ge3)$.

***Solution:***

**PMF of** $X$: $P(X=x)=f(x)=\binom{5}{x} 0.6^x (0.4)^{5-x} \ \ ;x=0,1,2,...,5$

*(i)* $P(X=2)=f(2)=\binom{5}{2} 0.6^2 (0.4)^{5-2}=0.2304$

*(ii)* $P(X \le 2)=F(2)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)=0.0102+0.0768+0.2304=0.3174$

*(iii)* $P(X \ge 3)=f(3)+f(4)+f(5)=0.6826$

***Alternative:(iii)***

$P(X \ge 3)=1-P(X< 3)=1-P(X \le 2)=1-F(2)=1-0.3174=0.6826$

**Finding Binomial probability using Binomial Table**

In the end of any Statistics book there are some **Probability Distribution Table**. We can use these table to compute the required probability for *specific values of the parameters* of certain probability distribution. Here I share the 1st page of **Binomial distribution table** [@baron_probability_2019].

**Exercise**[@walpole_probability_2017]

**5.9** In testing a certain kind of truck tire over rugged terrain, it is found that 25% of the trucks fail to complete the test run without a blowout. Of the next 15 trucks tested, find the probability that: (a) from 3 to 6 have blowouts; (b) fewer than 4 have blowouts; (c) more than 5 have blowouts.

***Solution**:*

Let, *X= number of trucks that have blowouts*

Given, $n=15; \ \ p=Pr(blowout)=0.25; \ \ q=1-p=0.75$. Hence, $X\sim Binom(n=15, p=0.25)$, that is:

$$
P(X=x)=f(x)=\binom{15}{x}(0.25)^x (0.75)^{15-x}; x=0,1,2,...,15.
$$

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

p1=dbinom(3,15,0.25)
p2=pbinom(6,15,0.25)-pbinom(2,15,0.25)

```

Now,

**(a)** $P(3\le X\le 6)=f(3)+f(4)+f(5)+f(6)$=`r round(dbinom(3,15,0.25),3)`+`r round(dbinom(4,15,0.25),3)`+`r round(dbinom(5,15,0.25),3)`+`r round(dbinom(6,15,0.25),3)`=`r round(pbinom(6,15,0.25),3)-round(pbinom(2,15,0.25),3)`.

***Alternative:*** $P(3\le X\le 6)=F(6)-F(2)=0.943-0.236=0.707$ \[from **Table**\]

**(b)** $P(X<4)=f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)$=`r round(dbinom(0,15,0.25),3)`+`r round(dbinom(1,15,0.25),3)`+`r round(dbinom(2,15,0.25),3)`+`r round(dbinom(3,15,0.25),3)`=`r round(pbinom(3,15,0.25),3)`.

***Alternative:*** $P(X< 4)=F(3)=0.461$ \[from **Table A2**\]

**(c)** $P(X > 5)=1-P(X \le 5)=1-F(5)$=`r 1-round(pbinom(5,15,0.25),3)`

**5.12** A traffic control engineer reports that 75% of the vehicles passing through a checkpoint are from within the state. What is the probability that fewer than 4 of the next 9 vehicles are from out of state?

**5.16** Suppose that airplane engines operate independently and fail with probability equal to 0.4. Assuming that a plane makes a safe flight if at least one-half of its engines run, determine whether a 4-engine plane or a 2-engine plane has the higher probability for a successful flight.

**5.25** Suppose that for a very large shipment of integrated-circuit chips, the probability of failure for any one chip is 0.10. Assuming that the assumptions underlying the binomial distributions are met, find the probability that at most 3 chips fail in a random sample of 20.

*And so on....*

## Poisson r.v

The number of events occur randomly in an interval or in a region usually follows Poisson distribution. A famous French mathematician *SimB4eon-Denis Poisson* (1781--1840) first introduced this distribution.

**Example**

The Poisson distribution may be useful to model variables like:

-   The *no. of calls* arrive at a customer care in *15 minites*
-   The *no. of arrivals* at a car wash in *one hour*
-   The *no. of repairs* needed in *10 miles* of highway
-   The *no. of leaks* in *100 miles* of pipeline etc.

Usually Poisson distribution is used to evaluate probability of "*Rare*" event.

The probability mass function of the Poisson random variable $X$, representing the *number of outcomes* occurring in a given time interval denoted by $t$, is:

-   **PMF**: $P(X=x)=f(x)=\frac{e^{-\lambda t}(\lambda t)^x}{x!}; \ \ x=0,1,2,...,\infty.$

Here, $\lambda$ is called *arrival rate* or *average number of occurrences* in long-run. And only *parameter* of Poisson distribution.

-   **Mean**: $\mu=E(X)=\lambda t$

-   **Variance**: $\sigma^2 =\lambda t$

-   **We write:** $X\sim Pois(\lambda t)$

**N.B**: The mean and variance of Poisson random random variable are *identical*. This is the *unique property* of Poisson r.v.

**Probability of plot of poisson r.v for different values of** $\lambda$ (for a fixed interval $t=1$)

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.height=2.5}

success <- 0:10
ps1<-dpois(success,1 )
ps2<-dpois(success,3 )
ps3<-dpois(success, 5)

wide.ps<-data.frame(success,ps1,ps2,ps3)
#wide.ps

long.ps<-wide.ps%>%gather(key = "p",value = "prob",-success)
#head(long.ps)

long.ps$p<-factor(long.ps$p,labels = c("lambda=={1}","lambda=={3}","lambda=={5}"))
#head(long.ps)

long.ps%>%ggplot(aes(success,prob))+
   geom_col(width = .3,fill="black")+
   facet_wrap(~p,labeller = label_parsed)+
   scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, length(success), 1),
                      limits=c(0, length(success)))+
   labs(x="x = # of success",y="f(x)",
        subtitle =expression(paste("Probability plot of Poissoin PMF for different values of"," ",lambda )))+
   theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(color = "black"))

```

We can see that, for small $\lambda$ the distribution of Poisson r.v is positively skewed and as the value of $\lambda$ increases the distribution tends to symmetry.

**Finding Poisson probability**

Consider a discrete r.v say $X\sim Pois(\lambda t)$. Suppose, $\lambda =1.5$ and $t=2$. Find, (i) P(X=4) (ii)$P(X \le 2)$ (iii) $P(X\ge3)$.

***Solution***:

**PMF** of $X$: $P(X=x)=f(x)=\frac{e^{-\lambda t}(\lambda t)^x}{x!}; x=0,1,...,\infty.$

**(i)** For $t=2$ , $\mu=\lambda t=1.5*2=3$.

So, $P(X=4)=f(4)=\frac{e^{-3}(3)^4}{4!}$=`r round(dpois(4,3),3)`.

**(ii)** $P(X\le2)=\sum_{x=0}^{2}f(x)=\sum_{x=0}^{2}\frac{e^{-3}(3)^x}{x!}=e^{-3}[\frac{3^0}{0!}+\frac{3^1}{1!}+\frac{3^2}{2!}]$=`r round(ppois(2,3),3)`.

**(iii)** $P(X \ge 3)=1-P(X< 3)=1-P(X\le 2)=1-0.423=0.577$

**Finding Poisson probability using Table**

We can use Poisson distribution table to compute Poisson probabilities. Here I share the 1st page of **Poisson distribution table** [@baron_probability_2019].

**Consider** a discrete r.v say $X\sim Pois(\lambda t)$. Suppose, $\lambda =1.5$ and $t=2$. **Find**, (i) $P(X \le 2)$ (ii)P(X=4)

***Solution by using Table***:

For $t=2$ , $\mu=\lambda t=1.5*2=3$.

**(i)** $P(X \le 2)=F(2)=0.423$

\[For x=2 and $\mu \ \ or \ \lambda =3;$ corresponding probability in **Table A3** is 0.423\]

**(ii)** $P(X=4)=f(4)=F(4)-F(3)=0.815-0.647=0.168$

**Example 5.17:**[@walpole_probability_2017] During a laboratory experiment, the average number of radioactive particles passing through a counter in 1 millisecond is 4. What is the probability that 6 particles enter the counter in a given millisecond?

**Example 5.18:**[@walpole_probability_2017] Ten is the average number of oil tankers arriving each day at a certain port. The facilities at the port can handle at most 15 tankers per day. What is the probability that on a given day tankers have to be turned away?

**Example 3.8:**[@pishro-nik_introduction_2014] The number of emails that I get in a weekday can be modeled by a Poisson distribution with an average of 0.2 emails per minute.

1.  What is the probability that I get no emails in an interval of length 5 minutes?

2.  What is the probability that I get more than 3 emails in an interval of length 10 minutes?

***Solution***

Let, $X$=number of emails that I get in a given interval.

Given, $\lambda =0.2 \ \ min^{-1}$.

$X$ will follow $Pois(\lambda t)$

**1.** In this case $\mu=\lambda t=0.2*5=1$. **So**, $P(X=0)=f(0)=e^{-\mu}=e^{-1}=0.3679$.

**2.** In this case $\mu=\lambda t=0.2*10=2$. **So**,$P(X>3)=1-P(X\le 3)=1-F(3)=1-0.857=0.143$. \[From **Table A3**\]

**Approximation of Binomial Distribution to Poisson**

When,

-   $p \rightarrow0$ (*Success rate is very low*);

-   $n\rightarrow \infty$ (*Number of trials is very large*);

Then **Binomial distribution** can be *approximated* by **Poisson distribution**.

-   Mathematically, $Binom (x; n,p)\approx Pois(\lambda)$; where $\lambda=np$.

**N.B: In practical situation** if $n \ge 30$ and $p\le 0.05$ ;hence $q\ge 0.95$,then the approximation is close enough to use the Poisson distribution for binomial problems[@baron_probability_2019].

**Example 5.20:**[@walpole_probability_2017] In a manufacturing process where glass products are made, defects or bubbles occur, occasionally rendering the piece undesirable for marketing. It is known that, on average, 1 in every 1000 of these items produced has one or more bubbles. What is the probability that a random sample of 8000 will yield fewer than 7 items possessing bubbles?

***Solution:***

Let,$X=number\ \ of \ \ glasses\ \ possesing\ \ bubbles$

Given, $Pr(buuble \ \ occurs)=p=1/1000=0.001$ which is less than $0.05$, and $n=8000$ which is greater than $30$. So, the PMF of $X$ can be approximated by Poisson distribution with

$$\lambda =np=8000*0.001=8$$ that is $X\sim Pois (\lambda=8)$

According to question,

$P(X<7)=f(0)+f(1)+...+f(6)=F(6)=0.313$ (*Ans.*)

[By using **Table A3**]

**Exercise 5.87:**[@walpole_probability_2017] Imperfections in computer circuit boards and computer chips lend themselves to statistical treatment. For a particular type of board, the probability of a diode failure is 0.03 and the board contains 200 diodes.

(a) What is the mean number of failures among the diodes? (***Ans:*** $\mu=np=200*0.03=6$)
(b) What is the variance?(***Ans:*** $\sigma^2=np(1-p)=200*0.03*(1-0.03)=5.82$)
(c) The board will work if there are no defective diodes. What is the probability that a board will work? ***Ans (c):*** The board will work if there are no defective diodes. So, P(The board will work)=$P(X=0)=f(0)=e^{-\mu}=e^{-6}=0.0025$
